# Clash Royale Starter Guide
## By way of introduction
You got Clash Royale, but now what?  You've played the tutorial and are playing against real people, and getting crushed: three-crowned
every game.  Well, it **feels** like every game.  It's not, because if it were every game, you'd have 0 crowns.

## Glossary
It's always a good idea to make sure everyone is speaking the same language.  To that end, we'll define a few things to make sure we're
all on the same page.
* Hitpoints
  * The amount of damage something can take before it dies.
* Damage
  * The amount of damage something can inflict.
* Direct damage
  * Anything that can damage a tower directly: fireball, arrows, lightning, rocket, zap, etc.
* Splash damage
  * There are things that inflict damage on an area instead of just a single target.  That extra damage is known as *splash* damage.
* King tower
  * This is the tower in the middle and where the king lives.  When he does shoot, he doesn't shoot as far, do as much damage, or
  as fast as the Princess towers.  The king tower has more 
* Princess tower
  * These are the two towers on the sides of the arena.  They guard the king tower and (hopefully) keep invaders from hitting it.
* Troop cards
  * Anything that moves in the direction of the opponent's towers.
* Building cards
  * Anything that is stationary
* Spell cards
  * Anything that's not a troop or a building.  Arrows, fireball, rocket, etc. are all spells.
* Tanks
  * Troops that can absorb a lot of damage.
* Elixir
  * The purple stuff that allows you to play your card.  90% of the game is elixir management.  Okay, maybe 80%.  When there is one
  minute left in the game, elixir rate is doubled, meaning you get twice the elixir per second you did in the first two minutes.  Cool,
  huh?  Well, your opponent is getting 2x elixir too.
* Lanes
  * There is a right lane and a left lane.  Troops have to go either right or left to get across the river in the middle of the
  arena.  The exception to this is flying troops and hog rider: hog rider is able to jump the river.
* Bridges
  * There is a right bridge and a left bridge that most troops have to cross to get into the river to the other side of the arena.

## What not to do
There are a couple of simple things that can make a world of difference.  We'll start with what *not* to do.
1. Do not fireball, arrow, or damage in any way, the king tower
  * The king tower doesn't join the fight until either a princess tower is destroyed or it takes damage.  Once it starts shooting too,
  it makes taking the princess tower **much** more difficult.  And since it's very difficult to win the game without taking a princess
  tower, this is a really Bad Idea.
1. Do not fireball, arrow, or damage the princess tower unless you can either take the tower or kill something.
1. Do not fireball, arrow, or damage tanks unless you can kill it or something near it.
  * Tanks can absorb a lot of damage and even rocket won't phase them.  This is a waste of elixir leaving an angry giant walking toward
  your tower and you have no elixir to stop it.
1. Don't drop your ranged troops in front of, or in, your opponent's troops.
  * Ranged troops like musketeer, archers, or bomber, do better when something isn't pounding on them.  It may be the difference
  between getting three shots off and two, or it may be the difference between having your tower taken.  Drop them far enough away
  the bad guys will need to go to them, but close enough that they'll be able to hit them.  Yeah, it takes some practice.
1. Don't drop high-elixir troops at the bridge/river.
  * You want to be able to support your troops and if you're out of elixir, you can't do that.  See #1 and #2 in **What to do**.

## What to do
Again, a couple of things that can make a world of difference.  They're simple things, but some takeowere practice.
1. Start your tanks, or troops, behind the king tower.
  * By starting slow-moving troops behind the king tower, it gives you time to build up elixir by the time it reaches the bridge.  Why
  is that important?
1. Backup your tanks with support
  * Tanks, by themselves, aren't great. They need support to help them along.  They really need a support *group*.  Giant?  Meh.  Giant
  with witch, archers, and bomber behind him?  Deadly.  Except ...
1. Don't bunch up your troops.
  * If your opponent has fireball or some other direct damage card, your amazing attack is going to evaporate in a cloud of purple mist.
  Better would be to space them out, or even ...
1. Split your attack
  * If you can, attack both lanes.  This causes your opponent to split their attack, and defense.
1. Wait until the opponent's troops cross the bridge before attacking them.
  * Once the troops cross the bridge, they are shot at by the princess tower.  The more things shooting at (or hitting) something,
  the better.  If you attack them *before* they cross, it's just you against them.  *After* they cross, it's you and your big bad
  princess tower against them.  2 against 1 is a fair fight, right?
1. Distract
  * Use distractions when your opponent pushes.  The distraction can be something simple, like skeletons, or something really big,
  like a giant.  When you drop your distraction, it's usually best to drop it in the middle toward the river.  This will draw the
  attackers so both princess towers can shoot at them.
  1.  Kiting
    * A little more advanced distraction is to drop your distraction on *just the other side*
  of the middle and make the attackers follow your distraction.  This is called "**kiting**".  To do this though, you need a troop that
  only attacks buildings and you need to make sure the attacker locks on to your distraction.  It's not easy, but it's an amazing tactic.
1. Use your towers as a resource
  * The only tower hitpoint that really matters is the last one.  It's okay for your tower to take some damage in exchange for a
  counter-push.  Just ... keep an eye on it.
1. Be patient
  * Just because you have enough elixir to play a card doesn't mean you should.  Wait, be patient, and let your elixir build up enough
  that you can drop two cards, or even three cards.  Did I mention elixir management?  If you play something everytime you have
  enough elixir, you leave yourself open, because you won't have enough elixir left to defend.
  * Once an attacker locks on to something they won't retarget until that target is gone. This includes the tower which means that nasty
  witch or baby dragon won't kill your skeleton army or minions and **then** kill your tower.  Let it lock on to your tower (see #7)
  and then drop your defenders.

## Gold and gems
Collect as much as you can of each.  No, really!  The general feeling, which I agree with, is don't buy common or rare cards in the
shop.  It may seem like a good idea, but it's just a waste.  By the time I got to Hog Mountain (arena 10), I had enough common cards
to upgrade most of my commons to level 12.  I didn't have enough **gold** to upgrade them though.  And now with epic Sunday, even
epics are attainable without spending gold or gems.  I would suggest buying epics only if they're available and fit your decks, and spending gold or gems on other cards in the shop.

Gems are useful, but wait until you're king tower level/xp level 8 or 9.  Once you reach xp 8, you can enter challenges and
tournaments. A suffix to this it to wait until your cards are tournament level before entering a challenge.
